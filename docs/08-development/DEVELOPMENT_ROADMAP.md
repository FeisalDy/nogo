# Development Roadmap

## 📋 Project Overview

This is a **novel reading platform** built with Go, Gin, and PostgreSQL using a **phased migration approach** for database evolution.

## 🏗️ Architecture Strategy

Instead of building everything at once, we use **incremental phases** to:
- Avoid complex relationship dependencies
- Test each feature independently  
- Handle optional relationships cleanly
- Scale development complexity gradually

## 📈 Development Phases

### ✅ Phase 1: Core Foundation (COMPLETED)
**Goal**: Basic user system and authentication

**Database**:
- ✅ Users table with authentication fields
- ✅ Migration system framework

**Features**:
- User registration/login
- Basic authentication
- User roles (user, admin, author)

**Files Ready**:
- `internal/user/model/user.go`
- `internal/database/migrations/001_create_users.go`

---

### 🔄 Phase 2: Content Management - Basic (READY TO START)
**Goal**: Core content creation and management

**Database** (activate by uncommenting migrations):

---

### 💬 Phase 5: Social Features  
**Goal**: Community interaction

**Database**:
- 📋 Comments (User ↔ Chapter)
- 📋 Reviews (User ↔ Novel)
- 📋 Ratings system
- 📋 User following

**Features**:
- Chapter comments
- Novel reviews and ratings
- User profiles
- Social interactions

---

### ⚡ Phase 6: Advanced Features
**Goal**: Platform enhancement

**Features**:
- Search functionality
- Recommendations
- Notifications
- Analytics
- Admin dashboard

## 🎯 Current Status & Next Steps

### ✅ What's Done:
- Migration system architecture
- User authentication foundation  
- Database connection with auto-migrations
- Documentation structure

### 🔄 Next Immediate Steps:

1. **Activate Phase 2 Database**:
   ```go
   // Uncomment in migrations.go:
   Migration002CreateNovels(),
   Migration003CreateChapters(),
   ```

2. **Build Novel System**:
   - Create `internal/novel/model/novel.go`
   - Create `internal/novel/repository/novel_repository.go`
   - Create `internal/novel/service/novel_service.go`
   - Create `internal/novel/handler/novel_handler.go`
   - Create `internal/novel/routes.go`

3. **Build Chapter System**:
   - Similar structure as novels
   - Handle chapter ordering
   - Relationship to novels

4. **Test & Validate Phase 2**:
   - CRUD operations work
   - Relationships are correct
   - No database errors

## 📁 Project Structure Evolution

### Current Structure:
```
internal/
├── database/migrations/     ← Migration system ✅
├── user/                   ← Phase 1 ✅
└── router/                 ← Basic routing ✅
```

### After Phase 2:
```
internal/
├── database/migrations/     
├── user/                   ← Phase 1 ✅
├── novel/                  ← Phase 2 🔄
│   ├── model/
│   ├── repository/ 
│   ├── service/
│   ├── handler/
│   └── routes.go
├── chapter/                ← Phase 2 🔄
└── router/
```

### After Phase 3:
```
internal/
├── database/migrations/     
├── user/                   ← Phase 1 ✅
├── novel/                  ← Phase 2 ✅ + Genre relationships
├── chapter/                ← Phase 2 ✅
├── genre/                  ← Phase 3 🔄
└── router/
```

## 🧪 Testing Strategy

### Per Phase Testing:
1. **Unit Tests**: Test each service independently
2. **Integration Tests**: Test database operations  
3. **API Tests**: Test HTTP endpoints
4. **Relationship Tests**: Verify foreign keys work

### Example Test Flow:
```go
// Phase 2 Testing
func TestNovelCreation(t *testing.T) {
    // 1. Create user (Phase 1)
    user := createTestUser()
    
    // 2. Create novel (Phase 2)  
    novel := createTestNovel(user.ID)
    
    // 3. Verify relationships
    assert.Equal(t, novel.AuthorID, user.ID)
}
```

## 🚀 Deployment Strategy

### Development Flow:
1. **Local Development**: SQLite for quick testing
2. **Staging**: PostgreSQL with test data
3. **Production**: PostgreSQL with migrations

### Migration Deployment:
```bash
# Production deployment
1. Backup database
2. Deploy new code  
3. Migrations run automatically on startup
4. Verify deployment success
```

## 📊 Success Metrics Per Phase

### Phase 1: ✅ Users can register and authenticate
### Phase 2: 📋 Authors can create novels and chapters  
### Phase 3: 📋 Novels can be categorized by genres
### Phase 4: 📋 Users can bookmark and track reading
### Phase 5: 📋 Users can comment and review
### Phase 6: 📋 Platform has search and recommendations

## 🎯 Why This Approach Works

### ✅ **Incremental Complexity**
Start simple, add complexity gradually

### ✅ **Independent Testing** 
Each phase can be tested in isolation

### ✅ **Clear Dependencies**
User → Novel → Chapter → Genre relationships are obvious

### ✅ **Rollback Safety**
Can rollback to any previous working phase

### ✅ **Team Collaboration**
Different developers can work on different phases

### ✅ **Business Value**
Each phase delivers working features to users
