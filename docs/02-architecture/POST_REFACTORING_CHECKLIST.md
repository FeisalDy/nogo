## üîß Required Actions

### 1. Update Client Applications

- [ ] Change registration endpoint from `POST /api/v1/users/register` to `POST /api/v1/auth/register`
- [ ] Test all existing API integrations
- [ ] Update API documentation (Swagger/OpenAPI)
- [ ] Update Postman collections

### 2. Testing

- [ ] Run existing unit tests
- [ ] Add unit tests for new application services
- [ ] Add integration tests for cross-domain operations
- [ ] Test transaction rollback scenarios
- [ ] Test Casbin synchronization

### 3. Deployment

- [ ] Review changes with team
- [ ] Deploy to staging environment
- [ ] Perform smoke tests
- [ ] Monitor logs for errors
- [ ] Deploy to production

## üß™ Test Scenarios

### Registration Flow

```bash
# Test new registration endpoint
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/v1/auth/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "username": "test_user",
    "email": "test@example.com",
    "password": "Test123!",
    "confirm_password": "Test123!"
  }'

# Expected: 201 Created with JWT token
# Should create user AND assign default "user" role
```

### Assign Role Flow

```bash
# Get JWT token first (login)
TOKEN=$(curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/v1/users/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"test@example.com","password":"Test123!"}' \
  | jq -r '.data.token')

# Assign admin role to user
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/v1/user-roles/assign \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "user_id": 1,
    "role_id": 2
  }'

# Expected: 200 OK with success message
```

### Get User Roles

```bash
# Get all roles for a user
curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/api/v1/user-roles/users/1/roles \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"

# Expected: 200 OK with list of roles
```

### Verify User Permissions

```bash
# Get current user with permissions
curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/api/v1/users/me \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"

# Expected: 200 OK with user data including roles and permissions
```

## üîç Verification Steps

### 1. Code Quality

- [ ] No compilation errors
- [ ] No linter warnings
- [ ] Consistent code style
- [ ] Proper error handling
- [ ] All imports used

### 2. Architecture

- [ ] No circular dependencies
- [ ] Domain services have no cross-domain dependencies
- [ ] Application services properly coordinate domains
- [ ] Transaction boundaries are correct

### 3. Database

- [ ] User creation works
- [ ] Role assignment works
- [ ] User-role relationships persisted correctly
- [ ] Casbin policies synchronized
- [ ] Transactions rollback on error

### 4. API

- [ ] All endpoints return correct status codes
- [ ] Error responses are consistent
- [ ] Success responses include proper data
- [ ] Authentication middleware works
- [ ] Authorization checks work

## üìä Performance Considerations

### Database Queries

- [ ] Check for N+1 query problems
- [ ] Verify proper use of transactions
- [ ] Monitor query performance
- [ ] Add database indexes if needed

### Response Times

- [ ] Measure registration endpoint performance
- [ ] Measure role assignment performance
- [ ] Compare with previous implementation
- [ ] Identify bottlenecks

## üö® Rollback Plan

If issues arise, rollback procedure:

1. **Immediate Rollback**

   ```bash
   git revert <commit-hash>
   # Or restore from backup
   ```
2. **Restore Old Endpoint**

   - Re-enable `POST /api/v1/users/register` in user domain
   - Keep both endpoints active temporarily
   - Gradually migrate clients
3. **Database State**

   - No database schema changes were made
   - No migration required for rollback
   - User-role data remains intact

## üìù Documentation Updates Needed

### External Documentation

- [ ] Update API documentation (Swagger/OpenAPI)
- [ ] Update README.md with new endpoints
- [ ] Update client SDK documentation
- [ ] Update integration guides

### Internal Documentation

- [ ] Update onboarding guides for new developers
- [ ] Add architecture decision records (ADRs)
- [ ] Update coding standards
- [ ] Update testing guidelines

## üéØ Success Criteria

- ‚úÖ API endpoints work as expected
- ‚úÖ Database operations are atomic
- ‚úÖ Casbin synchronization works
- ‚úÖ No performance degradation
- ‚úÖ Code is more maintainable

## üìà Future Improvements

### Short Term (1-2 weeks)

- [ ] Add comprehensive unit tests
- [ ] Add integration tests
- [ ] Monitor production metrics
- [ ] Gather developer feedback

### Medium Term (1-3 months)

- [ ] Refactor other cross-domain operations
